# Statistical Inference Pipeline Demos (SIP-Demos)
This repo comes from my UCSD Math 189 notes, adapted from professor Siddharth Vishwanath in UCSD's math department. It involves many really good and intuitive visualzied demonstration of different `ideas in statistics`, which is really good for education purposes.

Non of the demos here are meant for an deep tour into all the mathamatical details in statistics, but rather a visual demonstartion of them and how to use them, which includes techniques that has theoritical roots in an arange of UCSD Math classes (Math 181A, Math 181B, Math 181E)
